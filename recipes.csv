Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise,By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,Home \ Recipes \ Main Courses \ Seafood \ Seared Salmon With Saffron Hollandaise,Yield: 4 servings,"4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, pin bones removed
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil




Saffron hollandaise:

1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 medium shallot, minced
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1/8 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 1 tablespoon warm water
3 large egg yolks
2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, melted 
Sea salt 
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed  
1 tablespoon minced chives","To prepare the salmon: Season fillets generously on both sides with salt and pepper. To a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat, add oil. When oil is shimmering, add the salmon fillets, flesh side down, and sear on both sides until nicely browned and the flesh is no longer translucent in the thickest part of the fillet, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove salmon from skillet and place on a large plate; tent with foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce. 

To prepare the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine wine, vinegar, shallots, and peppercorns; cook until nearly dry. You should have about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Cool the reduction to room temperature, then strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl and combine with the saffron water. 

To prepare the egg mixture: To a medium saucepan, add water to reach 2 inches, and bring to a simmer. Add egg yolks to the bowl with the reduction and place the bowl over the simmering water, whisking constantly. To avoid overcooking the mixture, be sure that the water is barely simmering with no visible signs of surface action, just steam rising. As the egg yolks warm, they increase in volume. If they become too warm and begin to coagulate around the sides and bottom, remove from heat and cool slightly.

To prepare the hollandaise: When the yolks have tripled in volume and the mixture thickly coats the back of a spoon, after about 5 minutes, remove the bowl from the simmering water. Stabilize the bowl and begin adding the melted butter in a slow, thin stream, whisking constantly as it is incorporated. The sauce will begin to thicken as more butter is added. When the hollandaise is thick, velvety, and coats the back of a spoon, add the lemon juice and taste and adjust seasoning with salt and additional lemon juice as needed. If too thick, add a little warm water to thin the consistency.

If the sauce starts to break: It could be one of two things: either the butter was added too quickly, or the egg mixture got too hot (scrambled eggs). To rescue a broken sauce, try adding a small amount of boiling water and whisking until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter, or add another egg yolk to a clean bowl and set back over simmering water; whisk until thickened and using a fine mesh strainer to catch the scrambled egg, slowly strain the broken hollandaise gradually into the new egg yolk.

To serve: Place each salmon fillet on a warmed dinner plate and spoon hollandaise on top of each portion. Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately."
Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,By Tested and perfected in the Sur la Table kitchen,Home \ Recipes \ Main Courses \ Seafood \ Pan-Seared Scallops with Prosecco Butter Sauce,Makes 4 servings,"2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1-½ pounds sea scallops, tough ligament removed from the side 
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil, if needed
1 small shallot, minced
1 medium garlic clove, minced
1 cup Prosecco 
¼ cup whipping cream
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped chives","These succulent scallops are perfectly accompanied with sweet yet slightly acidic Prosecco in a delicate buttery sauce. For even cooking with a crisp exterior, it is suggested that the exterior of the scallops are patted dry prior to cooking, seasoned and allowed to reach room temperature before being placed into a hot pan. 

Remove the scallops from the refrigerator and season with salt and pepper. Allow to reach room temperature.

To cook scallops: Place a large non-stick skillet over a high heat;  add canola oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Carefully add the seasoned scallops to the skillet, sear until browned on both sides and just opaque in the center—about 2 to 3 minutes per side, depending on the size. Using tongs, transfer the scallops to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.

To prepare the sauce: Return the skillet to the stove over a moderate heat, and add the olive oil if the pan is dry. When the oil is shimmering, add the shallots and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the Prosecco; bring the liquid to a boil and cook, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a silicone spatula. Pour in the cream and continue to cook until the mixture has thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter a little at a time.  Stir in the lemon juice and chives, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. 

To serve: Divide the scallops between 4 warmed serving plates, ladle the sauce over the top and serve immediately."
Steak Tagliata with Arugula and Fried Capers,,Home \ Recipes \ Main Courses \ Meat \ Steak Tagliata with Arugula and Fried Capers,Makes 4 servings,"Steak Tagliata:

6 large cloves garlic, peeled, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
Flaky sea salt


Arugula and fried capers:
About 1 cup vegetable oil, for frying
¼ cup capers, rinsed and patted dry
5 ounces baby arugula leaves, stemmed
Best quality Aged Balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
2 ounces of Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved into thin slices
Lemon wedges, for serving","Traditionally, tagliata is a very simple preparation of thinly sliced grilled beef garnished with olive oil. This version includes infused garlic-rosemary oil, fried capers and a lemony arugula salad which adds nuance and flavor contrast to the classic perfectly grilled steak.

Rub the steak liberally with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Allow steak to sit at room temperature for about thirty minutes before cooking.

To prepare the garlic-rosemary oil: Combine remaining 2/3;-cup olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan and place over low heat. Cook until garlic starts to turn brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add chopped rosemary and freshly ground black pepper, stirring to combine.

To fry the capers: Fill a small saucepan with a ½-inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat until the oil registers 325°F on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a slotted spoon, carefully add capers to hot oil and fry, stirring once, until they begin to open and turn golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove fried capers with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside. 

Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the steak on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Using tongs, turn the steak and cook to medium-rare, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the steak registers 130°F, about 5 minutes more. (For steaks thicker than 1½ inches, transfer steak to a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and roast in a preheated 400°F oven to finish cooking.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.

To serve: Arrange arugula over a large serving platter or plates. Using a carving knife, cut the steak across the grain into ¼-inch thick slices and arrange over the greens. Drizzle some of the warm garlic-rosemary oil and aged balsamic over (reserve the rest of the garlic oil for other uses). Scatter the fried capers and shaved parmesan over the top. Serve immediately with lemon wedges."

After all, what’s better than a day completely devoted to a delicious feast shared by family and friends, all giving thanks for their blessings? This recipe takes an American classic to celebration status with a careful blend of spices and heavy cream, outshining the stale spice mix and evaporated milk of less enchanting recipes. Ever notice how spices clump up and don’t blend well when added to a custard? The trick is to blend them first with the eggs, whose fat helps the clumps disperse evenly, before adding any liquid to the custard mixture.
	
<>b>To prepare the pie crust: remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you are ready to roll it to allow it to soften slightly. Generously flour a work surface and place chilled dough disk on the flour. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll chilled dough into a circle, turning and flipping the dough as needed with a bench scraper to prevent sticking, until the circle measures 14 inches wide and ? inch thick. Starting at one edge, roll the dough around the rolling pin and lay it gently on top of a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough so it overhangs the edge of the pan by 1 inch. Fold the overhanging dough under itself around the pan edge, then crimp or form a decorative border. Chill the lined pan for at least 30 minutes. 

Preheat oven to 375&#176F and place a rack in the bottom third. 

Prepare the pie for blind baking: line the chilled pie shell with heavy-duty foil, pressing the foil firmly and smoothly into the crevices of the pan. Fill the pan with pie weights. Make sure the weights reach up the sides to the rim of the pan (the center does not need to be filled quite as full). Bake the shell for 20 to 22 minutes, until the foil comes away from the dough easily (if it doesn’t, then bake another 5 to 6 minutes and check again). Remove the pan from the oven, close the oven door, and lift out the foil and weights from the shell; set them aside to cool. Return the pan to the oven to continue baking the shell for about 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven, close the oven door, and check to see if any cracks have formed. If you see a crack, very gently smear a tiny bit of reserved dough over the crack to patch it—you need only enough to seal the opening. Return the pan to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes longer, until the crust is a nice golden brown all over. Transfer to a rack and cool slightly. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

While the pie crust is baking, make the filling: whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl to break them up. Add cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice and salt and whisk well to blend evenly. Whisk in the cream, brown sugar, granulated sugar and pumpkin and blend well. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly into the tart shell and bake until the custard is set, about 30 to 40 minutes. Test by tapping the side of the pie pan—the center of the pie should look firm and move as one piece. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool completely, about 2 hours.

Make the meringue: bring an inch of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the egg whites and sugar in the top of the double boiler off the heat. Set on top of the simmering water and whisk constantly (not vigorously, just enough to keep the whites moving) for 4 to 5 minutes, until the egg whites are hot to the touch and the mixture reaches 160-degrees on an instant read thermometer (the mixture should look frothy, but not whipped). Remove the whites from the heat each time you test their temperature. When they are on the heat, keep whisking to prevent scrambling. If that happens, there is no recourse and you will have to begin again, so watc"

1 head of garlic (not dried out)
12 tbsp (about 6 oz.) of black truffle butter at room temperature
1 cup of cream or half and half 
Olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper","Measure the cream or half and half and set aside to come to room temperature.

Cut the top off the garlic and set it in a square of foil large enough to envelop the garlic. Drizzle the garlic with olive oil, fold it up in the foil and roast it on a baking sheet in a 350° oven for about 40 minutes.

Toward the end of the roasting process, fill a large pot about ¾ full of water. Add 2 tsp salt and bring to the boil while you peel and quarter the potatoes.

Put the potatoes in the pot and pour off the excess water. (The water should just cover the potatoes). Cover the pot and cook 15–20 minutes until the potatoes are tender but not waterlogged.

Drain the potatoes and place in a large bowl with about half the butter. Give them the once-over with a potato masher or a ricer.

Unwrap the roasted garlic and squeeze the insides into a small bowl (remove any bits of the papery skin or other debris that may fall in). Add the garlic to the potatoes and mash or rice to your desired consistency.

Beat the cream into the potato mixture with a wooden spoon, adding a couple of tablespoons at a time.  (Note:  if the cream is still cold, take the chill off of it with a few seconds in the microwave.)

Add cracked pepper and salt to taste. A little additional cream is only a mistake if the potatoes are getting a bit watery, so feel free to add more as you like!

Press dough gently to remove air bubbles, and turn out on a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench scraper, divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a tight ball, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and allow dough to rest for 15 minutes.

Dust work surface with flour. Flatten one dough ball to a thickness of ½ inch, and roll to a diameter of about 5 inches, keeping the remaining dough covered. 

Transfer dough rounds to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with another piece of parchment. Continue rolling dough balls and placing on the baking sheet, separating layers of rolled dough with additional sheets of parchment, as needed. Cover stack of dough rounds with plastic wrap and set aside until ready to bake."
Rich Breakfast Dough,"By The Art &amp; Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Cindy Mushet, photography by Maren Caruso",Home \ Recipes \ Breads \ Dough \ Rich Breakfast Dough,Makes about 1½ pounds,"½ cup (4 ounces) warm whole milk (110° to 115°F)
¼ cup (1¾ ounces) sugar
1½ teaspoons active dry yeast, or 1? teaspoons instant yeast
1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
2½ cups (12½ ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, very soft (not melted)","A leaner version of brioche dough, this can be used for
all those wonderful, yeasted breakfast breads you love, like sticky buns and
coffee cake. Classic brioche, while delicious, is unnecessarily rich when paired
with flavor-packed fillings and toppings. Despite the reduced amount of eggs
and butter, this dough is still soft and easy to work with, and it bakes into a
tender, flavorful partner for all manner of fillings, both sweet and savory.

Mix and knead the dough: Combine the warm milk and sugar in the bowl of
the stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Whisk by hand to blend well.
Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, until the yeast is activated and foamy or bubbling.
Add the egg and yolk and whisk by hand until well blended. Stir in the flour and salt with a
silicone or rubber spatula. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed for 2 minutes.
The dough may look ragged at this point, but don't worry&#45;the addition of butter will smooth
it out. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 1 minute. With the mixer running, add
the soft butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, allowing each addition to blend in before adding the
next. Once all the butter has been added, decrease the speed to medium-low and continue
to knead for 5 to 6 minutes longer, until the dough looks soft and silky.

Rise the dough (first rise): Lightly butter or oil the tub or bowl, scrape the
dough into the tub, and brush the surface of the dough with a little butter or oil. Cover
with plastic wrap or a damp lint-free cotton towel and let the dough rise until doubled, 1
to 1½ hours. If you are using a tub, be sure to mark the starting level of the dough with a
pencil or piece of tape so it's easy to tell when the dough has doubled. At this point, the
dough is ready to be punched down and used in your recipe of choice.

Storing: The dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight. Wrap in plastic,
leaving a bit of wiggle room for when the dough continues to expand in the refrigerator, or
place in a bowl large enough to allow it to expand; cover with plastic wrap. (If you don't
leave room for expansion, the dough will burst through the plastic wrap.)"

Flaky Pie Dough,"By The Art &amp; Soul of Baking: Reprinted with permission of Andrews McMeel Publishing, recipes by Cindy Mushet, photography by Maren Caruso","Home \ Recipes \ Desserts \ Pies, Pastries & Tarts \ Flaky Pie Dough",Makes 1 (9-inch) pie crust,"1¼ cups all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, cold, cut into ½-inch cubes
¼ to 1/3; cup ice water","This recipe can be used to make both sweet and savory pies and tarts. You can make the dough ahead of time, wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze for 1 month. You can also save more time by making the dough in the food processor. Place the flour and cold butter in the processor bowl and pulse to cut the butter into the flour, then transfer to a large mixing bowl and proceed with the recipe. Make sure to weigh your ingredients for best results.

To make the dough, place the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, two knives or your fingers, cut or rub the butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Sprinkle ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, over the flour mixture. Stir and fluff the flour mixture with a fork until shaggy clumps form. Pick up the large clumps and squeeze to test for moisture. If clumps hold together, transfer them to a work surface and continue adding tablespoons of ice water and stirring.

Gather the clumps of dough together on a work surface. If the butter feels soft, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before proceeding. If the butter still feels cold, knead the dough gently 4 or 5 times. If dough falls apart, return it to the mixing bowl and sprinkle teaspoons of ice water and mix with a fork until dough holds together when squeezed. 

Flatten the dough into a disk about 6 inches wide, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling."
