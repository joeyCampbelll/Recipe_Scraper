# Recipe_Scraper

This Java program scrapes Sur La Table's recipe pages and gathers information from each individual recipe. In its current version, it takes the recipe's name, website path, servings, instructions, and ingredients. The program then takes this data and exports it into a .csv file. 

Rather than painstakingly navigating the website, this program takes the information you want and makes it easy to sort through and access.
